# What is Shiny Stratigraphy?

Shiny Stratigraphy is an interactive web-based tool for comparing different stratigraphic models of the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition using R Shiny. It is in early development at present and is subject to change substantially and without warning until a first major version is released. 

# Who's behind Shiny Stratigraphy?

Thomas Wong Hearing developed the Shiny app.

Fred Bowyer produced the age models, including carbon isotope stratigraphic compilations (and biostratigraphy which will be added shortly).

# Tasks to-do
- simplify data to be loaded (it is currently way more complex than necessary)
- add older (pre-550 Ma) data
- add model-specific moving average line
- add biostratigraphy tab (needs work on data more than code)
- decide on name and add to Cloud Connect or shinyapps.io
