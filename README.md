# What is Shiny Stratigraphy?

Shiny Stratigraphy is an interactive web-based tool for comparing different stratigraphic models of the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition using R Shiny. It is in early development at present and is subject to change substantially and without warning until a first major version is released. 

# Who's behind Shiny Stratigraphy?

Thomas Wong Hearing developed the Shiny app.

Fred Bowyer produced the age models, including carbon isotope stratigraphic compilations (and biostratigraphy which will be added shortly).
